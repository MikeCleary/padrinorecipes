Recipe Book App

This is a recipe book app built with Padrino and tested with shoulda.

Building on what we learned from our pardino blog exercise we made a more complex app based on the BBC good foods website. 

Features: CRUD capapbilites for recipes. Tagging with ActiveRecord through associations.
